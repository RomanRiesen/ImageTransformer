# ImageTransformer

Hacked together, unfinished thingy.

TODO: 
  - Zoom-in should regard the position of the cursor/fingers when zooming in; Currently just increases the whole plane, which moves the view to the middle when zooming. This may also result in not feeling like zooming in when the reduction in size of the image of the function is greater than that of the zooming.
  - Add a way to offset sampling coordinates
