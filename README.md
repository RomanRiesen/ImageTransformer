# ImageTransformer

Hacked together, unfinished thingy.

TODO: 
  - Zoom-in should regard the position of the cursor/fingers when zooming in.
  - Add a way to offset sampling coordinates (also rotation).
  - Currently assume input image is same as display; sampling should be scaled according to image ratio!
